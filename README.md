# Project-Title-Call-Center-Operations-Dashboard-Power-BI-Analysis-for-Service-Spot


This Power BI project was completed as part of an academic assignment, where the task was to assist a fictional IT company, Service Spot, in analyzing their call center data. The company needed a clear and insightful reporting system to understand their performance metrics and identify areas for improvement.

The goal was to build a robust Power BI report using proper data modeling, data transformations, DAX measures, and impactful visuals that provide answers to key business questions.
